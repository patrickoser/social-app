Comment as you go. It will help with comprehension and be a good
reference for later.

Learned: 

    Unique id auto generated by firebase for each post is just the doc id.

    When making a network request to an api, it is best practice to make a well constructed/structured request.
    Using all the data/state that is already client side when possible. The goal being to limit the number of api requests, 
    which in turn keeps load times manageable.

    When setting the likes state I was only able to store one posts likes at a time, so if I was trying to view more 
    than one post, I wouldn't get the right like numbers on each one. Now the likes state is apart of the posts state array 
    and so each post has their own likes object that contains each users like and the data that comes along with each post. 
    Before likes and posts were two seperate collections and two seperate states. Now they remain seperate collections 
    but they are combined/sorted into one state that is able to define/communicate each posts likes data more clearly.

Working on:
    Think about taking google user data creation out of the auth useEffect

    Look at other places I have used navigate from context and see if it makes sense to use useNavigate instead.

    Adjust security rules for firebase storage to limit what type of file can be uploaded and add size constraints to
    prevent abuse of storage.

    Adjust indentation of elements with long tailwind classes/other attributes to make it more readable. 

    When optimizing the performance of the project use Chrome Devtools/react dev tools to pinpoint 
    where the performance issues are originating from. 'useMemo' should help with some slower 
    components that use 'useEffect' so that they don't rerender needlessly.

Currently:
    Add Nav bar to Settings/Contact page.

    Add css structure to the posts pages.

    All instances of 'firestore' in Profile was replaced with 'db' but 'db' pops as an error 
    for not being a function on page load.(This seems to be fixed but leaving it just in case that changes so I remember what changed.)

todo:
    Have firebase check if the email used during sign up is
    already assigned to an account. Should check if user is 
    signing up with google or email/password. If the email is 
    already in use then it sends an error message back to the 
    user telling them they need to use a different email.

    Add a check to direct users straight to the home page if they 
    are already signed in to an account. Sign in and signup screen
    should not be available to users who are signed in.

    Use 'useMemo' in when interacting with firebase functions so 
    that they are not called everytime there is an 'onChnage' 
    event triggered. This counts as a 'read' and contributes to 
    billing.

    Figure out why reloading the page when on a specific PostPage 
    the page doesnt load properly.

    Look into setting up Tailwind to set some default colors
    and make it easier to reuse them throughout the project.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
