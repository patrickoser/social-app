Todo:

Pages needed:
    Home feed
        Could try making the feed scroll across the screen/left to right, instead of up and down.

        No need to have a seperate page for post creation, it should be a popup window, or a box that expands at the top like Twitter.

    Profile page
        Your posts scroll across the screen like the Home feed but have a wheel effect where the posts become bigger and emphasized as they reach the center of the screen. As if you are turing a wheel

    Login and signup
        Can be the same style as the comparable login and signup pages. Looked clean and can easily tweak the color and style as I want.

    Settings
        Doesn't have to be an extensive list, just a few features that make sense. Stuff like changing your display name.

    A page to display the individual posts you click on.
        Posts should have a like button, repost button, and section to add comments.

        To add comments to posts a drop down box will appear so that the user can add their comment. A whole new page is not needed. When the comment is add the page will scroll to the added comment.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
